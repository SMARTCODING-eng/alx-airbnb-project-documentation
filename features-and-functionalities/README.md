# Project Documentation: Airbnb Clone Backend

This document outlines the backend requirements and architecture for the ALX Airbnb Clone project. The goal is to build a robust, scalable, and secure server-side application that powers a modern rental marketplace.

## Core Functionalities

The backend is designed to support all essential features of a rental platform:

**User Management**: Secure user registration and login (email/password & OAuth) for guests and hosts, with profile management capabilities.

**Property Listings:** Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings with details like location, price, amenities, and photos.

**Search & Filtering:** Provides a powerful search functionality for users to find properties based on location, price, number of guests, and available amenities, with pagination for results.

**Booking System:** Manages the entire booking lifecycle, allowing guests to book properties, preventing double bookings, and tracking statuses (pending, confirmed, canceled).

**Secure Payments:** Integrates with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal to handle guest payments and host payouts securely.

**Reviews & Ratings:** Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings on properties after a completed booking to build trust within the community.

**Notifications:** Implements email and in-app notifications for key events such as booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.

**Admin Dashboard:** Includes an interface for administrators to monitor and manage users, listings, and bookings across the platform.

## Technical Architecture & Stack
The project is built on a modern and scalable technical foundation:

**Database:** A relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) is used to store data across normalized tables for Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, and Reviews.

**API:** A RESTful API is developed to expose backend services to the front end. It follows standard HTTP conventions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

**Authentication:** User authentication and session management are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.

**File Storage:** Cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Cloudinary are used for storing and managing property images and user profile pictures.

T**hird-Party** Integrations: The system integrates with external services like SendGrid or Mailgun for reliable email delivery.

### Non-Functional Requirements
Key considerations are in place to ensure a high-quality application:

**Scalability:** The application is built with a modular architecture to handle growing traffic and data.

**Security:** Follows best practices for data protection, including encryption for sensitive data and measures to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

**Performance:** Utilizes caching with tools like Redis and optimized database queries to ensure fast response times.

**Testing:** Emphasizes quality through unit, integration, and automated API testing to ensure reliability and stability.
